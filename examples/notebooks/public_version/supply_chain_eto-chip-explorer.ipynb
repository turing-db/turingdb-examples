Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity.\\n\\n300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today. Manufacturing the smoothest, high-purity 300 mm wafers-which are necessary for supporting the smallest chip feature sizes-requires considerable tacit know-how.

In particular, the Netherlands and Japan are exclusive providers of advanced photolithography scanners, necessary for mass-production of advanced chips.\\n\\nPhotolithography scanners use ultraviolet light to draw intricate, nanoscale patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the billions of tiny circuits contained in a single advanced logic chip. An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanner refracts a beam of 13.5 nm ultraviolet light through a photomask, transferring that pattern to a photoresist chemical applied as a layer on the chip. The light dissolves parts of the photoresist in the circuit pattern. The newly created photoresist pattern is etched into a permanent chip substrate below the photoresist. Throughout this process, the scanner precisely moves the wafer and the photomask helps build the design.\n",

Semiconductor fabrication facilities (\\ fabs\\ ) make chips in these wafers in two steps: forming transistors and other electrical devices in material layers within silicon wafers; and forming metal interconnects between the electrical devices in insulating layers above the silicon.

Firms headquartered in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China control the vast majority of the world s fab market share. In 2022, fab capacity was concentrated in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan (highest to lowest).
